# function overloading 

function overloading concept of polymorphism enables us to write same name mutiple functions/methods within a program.
but we have a restrictions that all the function having same name must follow-

1.no. of argument

2.type of argument

# object oriented programming (OOPS)

In C language it is POP(procedure oriented programming) but now C with classes,known as C++(C=C+1).

## Class

it is the combionation of data members(variables) and member function put together into a single unit.

# Object - object is an instance of class.

mainly it is a smaller unit which represent the bigger unit, class. object have the features or the property of the class.

class is a user defined data type.thats why we havee to intilize it.it provide security.

# access specifier / visibility modifiers(when used with inhertance)

## 1.private- directly cannot accessed(it give security if you want to access, through public you can access private)

## 2.public- direct accessed

## 3.protected - directly cannot accessed (at inheritance time it give permission to inhert but private cannot be accessed through inhertance)
